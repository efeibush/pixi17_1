Plasma in a tokamak is too hot to be contained by a physical material.  However due to its electrical charge, the plasma can be contained in a toroidally shaped magnetic field.  The visualization shows a poloidal cross section (R,Z coordinates in a 2-D plane) of the magnetic field, referred to as psi.  The field changes over time to contain the plasma in the experiment.  The data, stored in a netCDF file variable, is in the form f(x,y,t).  Each time step is extracted and plotted using Python matplotlib.  A short pause is inserted between plots so that each frame is displayed in the animation.
